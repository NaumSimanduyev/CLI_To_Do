Be sure that you keep main.py file in an empty folder because there will be created another file **data.json** in the **main.py** file directory.  
When you start the program __(__*python3 main.py* **or** *python main.py*__)__ you will see an actions menu.

(You can always quit the app using **CTRL+C** combination.)

You can choose three available options by typing their numbers *(e.g. by typing "1" you will be able to add a new task).* While adding a task you can choose either today's or another date.  
To remove a task you should type "3" in the main menu. Then you will see your current tasks. After that choose an appropriate date. You will see an ordered list of tasks related to this date.
